Sample App!
===================


Sample App is a demo web application build with **Rails**, the **Ruby's** popular framework.

----------


Description
---------------

The main purpose is to get the grip on basic **Rails** implementation.
This tut surveys model, view and controller implementation as well as unit and integration testing. So it's as complete as you can go. Not TO DO app here! Please don't feel insulted if you're used to get the TO DO tutorial on every framework you test, that's good for me as testing.
